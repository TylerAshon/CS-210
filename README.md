The project is a simple item tracking system that reads item data from a file, counts the frequency of each item, and provides functionalities to query these frequencies, print them, and visualize them in a histogram. It solves the problem of tracking and visualizing the occurrences of items from input data, making it easier to analyze item frequency trends. The most challenging part of the code was implementing the histogram functionality, which required formatting the output to display a visual representation of item frequencies. I overcame this by using string manipulation to generate the histogram bars. To support this, I am adding resources like documentation on advanced C++ string operations and debugging tools to my support network. Skills gained from this project, such as file handling, data visualization, and user input management, will be transferable to other projects involving data processing and interactive applications. To ensure maintainability and adaptability, I followed good coding practices by using descriptive method names, maintaining clear separation of concerns, and providing a user-friendly menu interface.
